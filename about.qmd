Welcome! I'm Victor, former insights manager at Facebook, Senior Financial Analyst at Google, Global Proposition Dev Manager at Vodafone Location Analytics, Galactic space traveler, amateur tv script writer & former hand model.

This blog is so I can practice learning R and Quarto and just have some data fun!
