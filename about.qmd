Welcome! I'm Victor, former insights manager at Facebook, Senior Financial Analyst at Google, Global Proposition Dev Manager at Vodafone Location Analytics, Galactic space traveler, amateur tv script writer & former hand model.

This messy blog is so I can practice learning R and Quarto and just have some data fun!

Most of my work has been proprietary but it's on my backlog to put some samples together.
